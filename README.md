# 911-Emergency-Call-Analysis 2015-2020

Overview
This project will be working on a dataset of 911 calls that happened between 2015 and 2020. From the data, there seems to be a lot of different trends, distributions, and patterns, such as time of day, month of year, and year in itself when these emergency calls happened, and for what various reasons they have been called for-EMS, Fire, Traffic. In this analysis, insight will be derived on any trend in the coming-in of emergency calls. This is a personal project undertaken for analysis of data.

Dataset
The following dataset on emergency 911 calls includes records of the following fields:
Date: Date and time the call was made.
Reason: Reason for the emergency (EMS, Fire, Traffic).
Title: Additional details related to the call.

Objectives
There is no single primary objective, but the goal is to present means of analytical techniques using Python, including Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

Key Analysis
1. Calls by Year and Reason:
Line and bar graphs were done to depict the yearwise distribution of calls coming at 911. - As the study shows, EMS calls have gradually increased till 2019, while Fire and Traffic Call follow mixed trends.

2. Monthly and Weekday Patterns:
   - Calls by month and weekday visualizations depict peak call volume, especially on weekdays.
   - Month by month breakdown: Most calls were received in January.

3. Distribution of the Reasons:
   - A pie chart was drawn to show the distribution in percentages by reason  - a rapid perception of the most frequent emergency type.

4. Cumulative Calls Over Time:
An area chart has been drawn to show the cumulative growth in 911 calls, reflecting a wider perspective of the trends in emergencies over the years.

Tools & Libraries
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- NumPy: Numerical operations.

Visualizations
The following types of visualizations are included in this project:
- Line graphs: Plot the trend of 911 calls by year and month.
- Bar charts: Plot reasons for the calls compared year to year.
- Pie charts: The distribution of the reasons of 911 calls.
- Cumulative area graphs: To show the total growth of calls over time.

Conclusion
This project has been an example of the kinds of insights possible with emergency call data. Understanding these patterns in the 911 calls can go a long way in enhancing emergency response planning, times of high activity, and consequently dealing with the roots of frequent calls.
